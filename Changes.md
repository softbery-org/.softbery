## Explanation of Changes

### Modified FileManager.UpdateFileVersion:

Added a parameter ``currentHash`` to pass the current file's ``MD5 hash``.
Checks the .sbver_files file to retrieve the previous hash of the file (if it exists).
Compares the current hash with the previous hash. If they match, the version update is skipped with a console message.
If the hashes differ or the file is not found in ``.sbver_files``, proceeds with the ``version update as before``.


### Integration with Existing File Hashing:

Leveraged the existing ``FileHash.CheckMD5`` method to compute the ``file's hash``.
Used the ``Program.ParseFileContent`` method to parse the ``.sbver_files`` content and retrieve the ``previous hash``.


### Preserved Existing Functionality:

The version increment logic in ``VersionManager`` remains unchanged, as it is only called when necessary.
The rest of the `FileManager` and `VersionManager` classes remain intact to maintain compatibility with other parts of the system.


### Error Handling:

Maintained existing error handling to ensure robustness.
Added console messages to inform the user when a ``version update`` is skipped due to no content changes.

***

These changes ensure that the version `(e.g., // Version: x.xx.xxx.xxx)` is only incremented when the file's content has actually changed, as determined by comparing the file's hash. The solution integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase and respects the single responsibility principle by keeping the hash comparison logic within `FileManager`.
